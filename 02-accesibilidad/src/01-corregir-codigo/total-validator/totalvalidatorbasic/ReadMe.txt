INTRODUCTION

Total Validator allows you to perform many different
validations on your web pages in one go, rather than using
several tools to achieve the same thing.

------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLING/UNINSTALLING

You must have Java 7.0 or later installed to run Total Validator.

Windows: To install simply run the .exe file you downloaded,
overwriting any previous installation. For older versions of
Windows use the 'Uninstall Total Validator Tool' option in the
Start Menu. For recent versions uninstall like any other
Windows program.

OS X: To install drag the TotalValidator icons into your
/Applications folder. To uninstall simply drag these icons
into your Trash. If any messages appear when you first try
to run Total Validator, please read the FAQ for solutions:
https://www.totalvalidator.com/help/faq.html#osx

Linux: To install copy the .tar.gz file you downloaded into
the directory of your choice and run the following command
to create a 'totalvalidator' directory which contains the
application:

	# tar xvfz totalvalidator.tar.gz

In order to automatically display the results in a browser
you may have to amend totalvalidatorbasic/default_browser.sh.
Use totalvalidatorbasic/total_validator.sh to run the tool.
